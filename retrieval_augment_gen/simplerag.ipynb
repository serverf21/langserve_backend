       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'manifesto.txt'}, page_content='The Communist Manifesto is divided into a preamble and four sections. The introduction begins: \"A spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of communism.\"[1] Pointing out that it was widespread for politicians—both those in government and those in the opposition—to label their opponents as communists, the authors infer that those in power acknowledge communism to be a power in itself. Subsequently, the introduction exhorts communists to openly publish their views and aims, which is the very function of the manifesto.[2]\\n\\nThe first section of the Manifesto, \"Bourgeois and Proletarians\",[3] outlines historical materialism, and states that \"the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\".[4] According to the authors, all societies in history had taken the form of an oppressed majority exploited by an oppressive minority. In Marx and Engels\\' time, they say that under capitalism, the industrial working class, or \\'proletariat\\', engages in class struggle against the owners of the means of production, the \\'bourgeoisie\\'.[5] The bourgeoisie, through the \"constant revolutionising of production [and] uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions\" have emerged as the supreme class in society, displacing all the old powers of feudalism.[6] The bourgeoisie constantly exploits the proletariat for its labour power, creating profit for themselves and accumulating capital. In doing so, however, Marx and Engels describe the bourgeoisie as serving as \"its own grave-diggers\"; as they believe the proletariat will inevitably become conscious of their own potential and rise to power through revolution, overthrowing the bourgeoisie.\\n\\n\"Proletarians and Communists\", the second section, starts by stating the relationship of \\'conscious communists\\' (i.e., those who identify as communists) to the rest of the working class. The communists\\' party will not oppose other working-class parties, but unlike them, it will express the general will and defend the common interests of the world\\'s proletariat as a whole, independent of all nationalities. The section goes on to defend communism from various objections, including claims that it advocates communal prostitution or disincentivises people from working. The section ends by outlining a set of short-term demands—among them a progressive income tax; abolition of inheritances and private property; abolition of child labour; free public education; nationalisation of the means of transport and communication; centralisation of credit via a national bank; expansion of publicly owned land, etc.—the implementation of which is argued would result in the precursor to a stateless and classless society.\\n\\nThe third section, \"Socialist and Communist Literature\", distinguishes communism from other socialist doctrines prevalent at the time—these being broadly categorised as Reactionary Socialism; Conservative or Bourgeois Socialism; and Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism. While the degree of reproach toward rival perspectives varies, all are dismissed for advocating reformism and failing to recognise the pre-eminent revolutionary role of the working class.\\n\\n\"Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Opposition Parties\", the concluding section of the Manifesto, briefly discusses the communist position on struggles in specific countries in the mid-nineteenth century such as in France, Switzerland, Poland, and lastly Germany, which is said to be \"on the eve of a bourgeois revolution\" and predicts that a world revolution will soon follow. It ends by declaring an alliance with the democratic socialists, boldly supporting other communist revolutions and calling for united international proletarian action—\"Working Men of All Countries, Unite!\"')]"
